## Face-mask-detection-and-temperature-sensing-device
We developed Artificial intelligence based model in COVID-19 which detect face mask with accuracy 97.68% and sense the body temperature from distance 1.5meter. System embedded on raspberry pi 4. This system is IoT based.  Technologies: Python, openCV, IR Thermal sensors, tensorflow/keras, numpy and pandas.
We implement this code on raspberry pi 4 with having 32 gb microsd card.
1st we train the model by using supervised machine learning using opencv library of python
we provide more then 110 samples of datasets having with mask and with no mask
after train data we use tensorflow to build this model
